Python Chatbot


This NBA Chatbot is a playful, conversational bot that lets you ask about some of the biggest names in basketball! The bot responds to player-related queries with info stored in a JSON file, and it even has some witty responses for you.

# Files
main.py: This is the chatbot's main script. It loads player data, handles user input, and provides responses.
basketball_players.json: A JSON file containing data on various basketball players. It has stats and unique descriptions for each player, from current stars to retired legends.
How It Works
The chatbot loads up data from basketball_players.json and waits for your input. You can ask about players directly by name, or just say "hello" to start a conversation. If you want to exit, just type "exit," and the bot will sign off with its own spin.

Here’s a quick preview of how it looks when you run the chatbot:


# Running the Chatbot
Make sure both main.py and basketball_players.json are in the same directory.
Run main.py in a Python environment.
Interact with the bot by typing a player’s name or saying "hello."

# Sample Responses
